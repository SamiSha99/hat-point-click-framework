# Point and Interact Framework v1.1.0
A framework made for modding puporses that allows modders to create point and click interactivity between the player and the world around them. The system is entirely built upon "Hat_HUD" a system found in the game with the addition of interactivity through actors and Kismet functionality.

The implementation is quick and simple and allows a lot of customizability through changing the mouse look, colors when Un/Hovering and size.

The system interacts through "point and click" with "3D buttons" that the player can drop in the scene and the rest is done through Kismet.
